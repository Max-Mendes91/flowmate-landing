# FlowMate

**FlowMate** is your AI-powered assistant for email, meetings, and team communication — designed to help you work faster, smarter, and with less context switching.

FlowMate connects with Gmail, Outlook, Google Calendar, Slack, WhatsApp, and Telegram, letting you automate routine communication tasks using natural-language commands.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Send emails with a single sentence**  
  Write a short instruction (“Email the team about tomorrow’s stand-up at 10 AM”) and FlowMate drafts and sends the email for you via Gmail or Outlook, capturing your tone and context.

- **Schedule meetings automatically**  
  FlowMate understands your intent, parses dates and times, checks your availability, and sets up calendar events (including across time zones).

- **Post updates to Slack**  
  Create messages or reminders in Slack without leaving FlowMate. Send to channels or individuals using natural language.

- **WhatsApp & Telegram automation**  
  Send messages, automate conversations, and manage chats across WhatsApp and Telegram through FlowMate.

- **Context-aware AI confirmations**  
  After you ask FlowMate to do something, it shows a preview (e.g., email content, calendar event, or message) so you can confirm or edit before execution.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Type your request** in plain natural language — no special syntax or commands needed.  
2. **FlowMate parses your intent**, extracts relevant details (recipients, times, subject, etc.), and shows a quick preview.  
3. **Actions execute across all connected tools**: the email is sent, the event is created on your calendar, and the Slack message is posted — all in one go.
